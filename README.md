Lower-limb amputation severely compromises mo-
bility and quality of life. Although prosthetic technology has
advanced considerably, most existing designs prioritise ankle
actuation while neglecting the coordinated role of the toe joint
and plantar arch. This dissertation addresses this gap through
the design, simulation, and prototyping of a powered below-knee
prosthesis that integrates independently actuated ankle and toe
joints supported by an anthropomorphic arch structure (PAN-
TAR). Anatomical analysis, inverse-dynamics modelling, and gait
studies are used to derive quantitative design targets, which guide
the development of a dual-joint actuation architecture incor-
porating series-parallel elastic elements with embedded sensing
and control. Dynamic simulations establish feasibility and inform
parameter selection, after which a prototype is fabricated using
additively manufactured polymer components and RoboMaster
brushless DC actuators with STM32-based control. Equivalent
functional tests demonstrate stable joint tracking, reproduction
of characteristic kinematic and dynamic gait patterns, and ankle
and toe torques consistent with human biomechanics, thereby
bridging the gap between simulation and physical implemen-
tation. While limited by polymer materials, simplified control,
and the absence of amputee trials, the results demonstrate the
feasibility of a laboratory prototype that establishes proof-of-
concept: compact, lightweight, and cost-effective prostheses can
integrate compliant ankle and toe actuation to enhance biome-
chanical fidelity. The project contributes theoretical foundations,
practical insights, and a working laboratory prototype that may
inform future generations of clinically viable bionic lower-limb
prostheses.
